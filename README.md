# LinkedRails
LinkedRails is a gem for Ruby on Rails that helps you create a Linked Data application a matter of seconds.

It includes among other things:
* Linked data serialization to Turtle, JSON-LD, N-Triples and more using [rdf-serializers](https://github.com/ontola/rdf-serializers)
* Controller abstraction using [active_response](https://github.com/ontola/active_response)
* Serialization of forms using the [SHACL spec](http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl)
* Serialization of collections using the [Activity Streams spec](https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams)
* Serialization of menus
* Communicating actions to be executed by the frontend using Exec Actions header
* Rendering errors as RDF
* Parsing linked data graphs as params

## Work in progress
This gem is an extraction from an existing app. Tests are not yet sufficient but will be extended soon.
